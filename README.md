## Programming 1 - IDATA 1001

This course dives into the basic principles of object-oriented design and object-oriented programming (OOP) - definitions and concept in OOP (classes, objects, encapsulation). This course was graded by an portfolio work and is in an another repository, click [here](https://github.com/ejhasler/idata1001-warehousesystem) to get to the project repository.

In the course we had a project called "Warehouse Management System", where the goal of the application was to create a software solution for the administration and handling of a warehouse. The finished product will consist of a text-based user interface that provides an overview of the goods in the register and includes the necessary features to meet the requirements. The requirements for the application were published by the subjects teacher, so the functionality is mainly based on these requirements. Some additional functionality was selected from the candidate. The project had also a report or README.md file that is discussing the problem the application should solve, the development process, the underlying theory and design strategy, as well as the results and reflections from the candidate.

Click here to get to the [README.md](https://github.com/ejhasler/idata1001-warehousesystem) file and the source code of the project.

### INFT2503 - C++ for programmers

This course is designed to provide you with an in-depth understanding of system programming languages in Unix-like systems such as Linux and MacOS. The course will focus on C++, which is a popular system programming language. We will also compare C++ to other relevant system programming languages such as C and Rust.

System programming languages are designed to be efficient in terms of resource management, memory utilization, energy consumption, and runtime performance. These languages offer better performance in these areas compared to other programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript. 

Throughout the course, you will learn about various aspects of system programming languages. We will cover resource management, object-oriented programming, error handling, containers, functional algorithms, constant expressions and template meta-programming, parallelization and asynchronous programming, and operator overloading. 

By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of system programming languages and their benefits. You will be able to apply this knowledge to create efficient and high-performance programs in Unix-like systems.

### IMAA2150 - Mathematical methods 3 for computer engineers

This course covers topics related to Vector spaces and linear transformations, differential equations, and numerical methods. The course starts with Vector spaces and linear transformations, including subspaces of Rn, general vector spaces, function spaces, and norms. It then moves on to matrix transformations, null spaces, and column spaces, and their application in Fourier series and the solution of partial differential equations. 

The course also covers differential equations with solution methods, which is an essential field of study in mathematics and science. Students will learn various solution methods and techniques for differential equations. 

In addition, the course features numerical methods: Representations of floating-point numbers in the computer, calculations with floating-point numbers, and various sources of error. Students will learn about error magnification, condition, and convergence rate. The course also covers direct methods like the solution of linear equation systems, PA = LU factorization, least squares method, interpolation with cubic splines, and Bezier curves. Iterative methods include Newton's multivariate method, solution of linear equation systems such as Jacobi and conjugate gradients, calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the solution of some types of differential equations like Runge-Kutta. 

By the end of the course, students will have a strong understanding of Vector spaces and linear transformations, differential equations, and numerical methods. They will have the skills and knowledge to apply these concepts to solve complex problems in mathematics and science.

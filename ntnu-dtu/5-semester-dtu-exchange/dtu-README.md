## Courses

### 41740 Digital Manufacturing - Industry 4.0

In this course, you will learn about digital tools used for analyzing manufacturing processes, with a focus on additive manufacturing and injection molding. You will gain an understanding of data classification, processing, and quality, as well as data-driven models and first principles models for describing temperatures, material flow, stresses, and deformations. You will also learn about Reduced Order Models (ROMs) and how they can be used to optimize manufacturing processes. By the end of the course, you will have a comprehensive understanding of various analytical approaches and tools used in manufacturing processes.

### 02110 Algorithms and Data Structures 2

This course covers the fundamentals of computer science, including algorithm analysis and asymptotic notation. It also covers various data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, heaps, priority queues, hash tables, union-find, and binary search trees. 

Moreover, the course delves into essential topics such as searching and sorting, including binary search, heap sort, insertion sort, and merge-sort. 

Lastly, it covers graph algorithms, which are crucial in computer science. This includes single source shortest paths (including Dijkstra and SSSP in DAGs), minimum spanning trees, topological sorting, breadth-first search, depth-first search, and graph representation.

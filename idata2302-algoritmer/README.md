## Java Programming Basics

```
public class Universe {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       system.out.println("Hello World!")
   }
}
```

In Java, executable statements are placed in functions, known as a method, that belong to class definitions. The Universe class, in our first example, extremely simple: its only method is a static one named main, which is the first method to be executed when running a Java Program.
